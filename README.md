## My Mission

This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.
I want to be able to write and save notes so that I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete.

## Criteria

Given a note-taking application
When I open the Note Taker, then I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
When I click on the link to the notes page, then I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, 
plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
When I enter a new note title and the note’s text, then a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
When I click on the Save icon, then the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand 
column with the other existing notes
When I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column, then that note appears in the right-hand column
When I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page, then I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the 
note’s text in the right-hand column.

## Build

Set up some starter code
Created a server.js, starter folders/files and local host port for listen
Installed express and fs - test listening on port
reviewing get and push code
delete is a work in progress - need to double check if it relates to the pre-provided index.js
the index.js code looks like it needs some work.
testing on Postman - not recognizing notes file.
got a few post requests as I progressed but need to work out links from rearrangeing pile structure
for now turn in
